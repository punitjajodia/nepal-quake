This is to kindly inform you all that in the far west region of Gorkha, due to the landslide the roads(kaccha) also have seems to be destroyed completely, taking away more than 150 Donkeys death, which use to carry loads to reach up the mountain, near the lake.
Today is the fifteenth day and currently there is no source of way to reach up there, except for the expert climbers. It is sad to tell you all that the local people in that zone who we met told me that the locals there have all started feeling that they belongs to no one’s lands, as time has passed and they are just left haphazardly with no source of basic relief until now.
I do not know how to put up this word correctly but I have this strong feeling that the leaders of the country who are leading are playing with the sentiments of the civilians right now, be it you me or any.
It is of a big surprise to me that how it is even possible for the government to charge one and half lakh to two and half lakhs, of rupees for delivering the relief material to anyone interested at that particular zone?  Where else the relief material that only fits in the helicopters are worth not even more than fifty to sixty thousand rupees only, is a question to me.
This is not the time to do business is how I think. Either we have forgotten our rights to public property else the government has forgotten it’s the public’s property.
Finally, after the fifteenth day the Secretary of the wards that you will see in the video(First left hand side of the screen is Dhurbaraj Parajuli, a Secretary of Keranju, VDC-9) is moving today along with other EIGHTY SEVEN i.e. 9th May. Where else when I tried to reach out to the CDO of Gorkha district, his cell phone was switched
.  Eventually I consider this INHUMAN!!!!
I, would kindly request you all to appeal in this regard as many of our brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers are all crying out loud for help and we think should also think outside the box as I am sharing the correct information if you all are not informed well, that there has been no relief material properly sent there .
Let us all help!!!!!
Here is some collective information please kindly get an idea how to reach there. 
Most importantly we should ask for free service
P.S. I do not recommend anyone to go hiking there with the relief material as we were told that it’s an unusual and awkward small thin ways where soil erosions are high, every day, along with 100 meters down there is a river flowing
The routes to reach there are as follows:
Day 1: Kathmandu - Gorkha Bazaar to Swoti (By Bus) Manabu (Hiking)
Hiking starts
Day 2: Manabu - Dauraht- Dhunche - Chaihtey Khola - Kashigaun (O/N)

Through my volunteer work with StandbyTaskforce, I was initially in contact with them in the first week, as they sought food and medical assistance for their injured. Today, the english speaking man in their group (Uday Parattha Ph. +977 9849027000), contacted me again by phone to see if I could pass through a request for engineers and materials to help build shelter for their genuinely displaced people only.

So I believe that many of the initial 600 families have no shelter or sanitation. They are seeking plastic sheeting to make shelters from, and hopefully some engineers to help them prepare shelter and sanitaytion (toilet) facilities.

In the long term, they are interested in building a district centre combining public health and education, and hope some engineers may volunteer to help with that but right now they are seeking seom materials and volunteer engineer help with sanitation facilities and shelter for their displaced families.

I tried calling Uday again, while filing this request, to get a better understanding of how many people require shelter but I could not get through.

I am reporting this from Australia - my name is Alistair Hart (+61 409 885 776 - alistair@mangoesmapping.com.au). I was helping with SBTF prior to our being stood down when we handed over our data to KLL. That is why this man Unday has contacted me,as I've been managing his initial request when we were active.

NB. I could not find a location name for this village and cannot locate my original request in the SBTF google sheets, so the Location name I have used is the closest I could find in Google Earth. Katunjepuni the location I have nominated is ~6-7KM west of the actual location of the families requiring shelter.","Food/Water/Shelter/Sanitation, Other, ","27.967442","84.998408","9849027000","Dhading","Exact location","Alistair","Hart","alistair@mangoesmapping.com.au",YES,YES,Actionable,YES,"Contacted Uday Parattha who with his friends ran a relief program in Dhading for a week.Mainly in ward no 1,2,3.

We took one of the local villagers with us.

We had no place to land the chopper so we hovered 30 ft in air, opened the chopper door in high wind and rain and threw food out the door to them. It was scary and risky but worth every effort.

They need evacuation. This supply likely will last them only a few days.

We barely just put a band aid on a bleeding jugular. This village is 15 minutes flight from KTM airport. 
Gokul Thapa is my hero who risked his life to save these people. I was holding him while he threw 30 kg bags of rice out the door. I don't need your money , I need your voice call, you congressman call your media. The world needs to know.

This is a humanitarian catastrophe. 
They will die of hunger and exposure or mud slides once the monsoon arrives if they make it through the next few weeks. I can't save them all. I need your voice, so the Nepalese government and world

This is an appeal to support the earthquake victims of Bungkot VDC Ward No. 4, Gorkha, Nepal. A 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal on 25th April, 2015 have obliged affected peoples live in the open fields and barren land and under the open sky too in some case though 14th day of such devastating quake had already passed.

Food and medical supplies are running quite low that too with insufficient reliefs while risks are looming large for the health epidemic as a result of temporary open shelters and unhygienic food. More than 95% of the houses (total of about 120 houses) in this area are damaged ( completely damaged houses about 90 %). With the monsoon season imminent, the need for shelter is increasing.  

I, Pradeep Parajuli, an engineering student from Kathmandu University, had personally visited this VDC yesterday (dated 7th May, 2015) with stuffs I can carry and distributed it to 3 nearby houses and help them in excavation too. I had taken photographs showing the destruction of houses, temporary settlements, tents limitation.

Herein is attached the photographs showing the miserable condition of the whole VDC. Your rescue team is doing quite good. I would be grateful if your rescue team could do something for that VDC too.

4.   Security Updates

NTR

5.   Updates by District
 

Gorkha: 06 May, according to District Education Office (DEO) in Gorkha district, more than 80% of 498 government schools buildings have collapsed whereas remaining 20% have been partially damaged. The destruction of school has affected approximately 84,000 students in the district.

6.   Forecasted Weather
·         07 May, Showers  and  thunderstorms  are  expected  across  Nepal  on  Thursday,  particularly  across  the mountains but there is a continued moderate probability of a thunderstorm in Kathmandu. The focus for thunderstorms is likely to be across eastern Nepal, where some could be severe with hail and flooding rains. There is a low risk of locally heavy rainfall triggering landslides, and with higher warmer temperatures  in  mountainous  regions  than  recently,  increased  snow  melt  is  expected  at  lower elevations. This increases the risks for avalanches at higher elevations.

·         08 May, There is a consistent signal for a further significant increase of clouds, shower and thunderstorms across Nepal, including Kathmandu, on Friday and throughout the weekend. These storms will produce a significant risk of hail, flooding rains, landslides and increasingly strong gusty downdrafts. The snow level will rise further to 4200-4400 meters. This may continue to increase the level of snow melt at lower elevations, while increasing the avalanche risk in higher elevations. Maximum temperature at Kathmandu will be a little lower as in the previous days at around 26 or 27 Celsius.

So far, it looks like the survivors of Langtang that are staying in Kathmandu as well as the ones in Kyanjin gumba are all being provided for by other organizations so we are directing our efforts to surrounding rural areas. So far we've sent supplies to village in Dolakha and Melamchi near Helambu region. We could really use your help to figure out where the help is needed the most. We've heard reports saying there are people starving in Gatlang which we are trying to figure out how to get to. Can we combine our efforts? Do you guys have more volunteers in Kathmandu that you can connect us with that can help our ground team with the relief efforts? Looks like you've been doing some really good work collecting and combining information and I think together with our relief efforts we can help a lot more. Please let us know.

Whole village dispersed, approx. 700 people now living in 4 new tent villages close together. 
Water: Main issue is that the water source is a half hour walk away across a landslide. Therefore specific request is for 3km length of 32mm diamter piping &amp;amp; 1x 15kg bag of cement to channel water to new location (ideally by helicopter).
Sanitation is not being handled well so concerns over the water source are high. Failing this, perhaps large water containers could be dropped or at least large quantities of hand sanitizer - soap is irrelevant at this time. 
Also required; blankets and clothing as there are currently none.
Medical status: there are no critical injuries but widespread diarrhoea, hacking cough and infected small wounds. There is a trainee medical practitioner to whom we have given our medical supplies. His contact details; Ramesh Tamang 9741273827. He is requesting more bandages, suture sets, pain killers, diarrhoea medicine etc. as his clinic was completely destroyed. 

We have managed to arrange privately a small helicopter to land in Sattyadevi to airlift out 2 injured people. This is happening 5/5 and at the same time some food and additional medicine (focussing on diarrhoea) will be dropped to be shared with this village cluster in Ree VDC.

Additional information; the team just (2pm May 5th) witnessed an army helicopter landed today down hill from Ree village (coordinates above) but within Ree VDC at a new school building (probably known landmark) 10 army personnel handing out supplies.","VDC Trip Summaries, Medical Assiatance, Food/Water/Shelter/Sanitation, ","28.11","84.97","9813539769","Dhading","Exact location","Jessica","Stanford","jessica_stanford@yahoo.co.uk",YES,YES,Actionable,NO,"","Thank you for the detailed update.

Village: Sangachok

Nepal
Date of visit: 04/05/2015
Estimated population: around 7000
Damage on buildings: 90 % of houses collapsed, 10 % with major cracks and unsuitable for living inside
Transport and accessibility: Cars and buses can access the village, but there have been many landslides on the way and due to the continuous aftershocks, there is a risk of blockage of the roads. The landscape of the village is very hilly with variation of altitudes across the whole area, which has caused blockage of pathways, covered with rubble. The access to the main road is difficult.
Aid presence: So far only the organisation Save the children has reached with help to the settlement, delivering food and providing medical support. Most of the supplies could not reach the village, since they have been taken and utilized by the villages at lower altitude.
Shelter: 100 % of people live outside, around 10 % sleep in tents or under plastic sheets
Food: 50 % of people have food supply for about a week, 50 % less than a week
Drinking water: Local source, but shortage reported
No report for conflicts and aggression so far.

"1462","Earthquake Assessment Report | Gati &amp;amp; Ghumthang VDC - Sindupalchowk","2015-05-04 22:52:00","Gati Sindupalchowk","01st May 2015 | Namaste Nepal
Villages Assessed / Being Assessed
Gati, Dandakateri, Nakuche, Samasadhu, Mandra and Sotang.
Location on Strava - https://www.strava.com/activities/297713765
Gati - 112 Households
Damage - Only three structures standing (Kindergarten, a hollow brick house, and part of the secondary school)
Deaths - 4
The trail leading to Gati is shredded, and there are open gash landslides. The agricultural road access has been damaged by landslide or rocks standing on the way. The water taps are suddenly full of water (looks like a new acquifer has joined with the original source)
Dandakateri - 78 Households
Damage - Only three houses standing (hollow brick houses)
Deaths - 3
The trail leading to Dandakateri is damaged and shredded. The ancient trail to Tibet connecting Dandakateri and Gati is dangerous as there are rocks hanging out from the recent landslides caused by the earthquake. The water dried out here, but the locals have braved the conditions and re-connected the pipes, so water is back on. The spring water is a bit sour (sulphur?)
Reports still coming in from Mandra, Sotang, Nakuche and Samasadu. Teams were there on recce on the 01st and 02nd of May.
This will expand the coverage of this report to about 1000 households, but only covers 6 wards of the two VDC’s which have a total of 18 wards. This is the immediate working area of Namaste Nepal, but relief might have to be expanded to cover the two VDC’s, which will take the total to about 3000 households.
They are bringing back list of households, the damage report, the death toll, the number of children below 10 and the number of children below 5.
——
Two board members of Namaste Nepal are from this village. Mohan Shrestha and Ramesh Lama, both of whom have lost their houses.
Adaptation: The villagers in this area are constructing temporary shelters from wood and tin salvaged from their broken down houses, and using bamboo and some agricultural plastic or tarp or tin. Some have even used the slate that was on the roof as flooring material. Some are sleeping on straw.
The dead have been cremated and the animals buried. The villagers are extremely busy building their medium term shelters
Emergency Relief Priorities
Tarp
Rice and Lentils and supplemental food supplies
Mid Term Priorities (though best to go in straight away)
Temporary toilets
Water Tests
Temporary school
Temporary Health Post with supplies
Temporary gathering space for meetings for village level decisions
Methodology:
In a discussion with the Board of Namaste Nepal, these were the decisions made locally
The emergency relief supplies would be controlled by the Youth Groups - a leader has already been formed, and the base for this will be the Borderlands Resort, which is connected by road.
Lists of all households will be used to ensure there is no duplicacy
In case of shortages of supplies, women with children, marginalised groups will be prioritised. 
NOTE: And example of this was already in practice. As we reached with low supplies, the youth group immediately decided in favour of marginalised groups and the Dalits got the first priority in this area. After that, the rest was kept in storage awaiting better supplies, in order to maintain social harmony.
An information board has been set up at Borderlands for Rescue teams, international aid coming in, and help groups coming in that area - outlining who all has already reached there, and trying to collate what they learnt in order to avoid duplicacy.
Challenges
Safety. The area is still very fragile and the tremors are felt more than in other places. There is a chance that some landslides will happen, specially if it rains
Pilferage. Reaching Gati needs going via the Dolalghat - Barabise stretch where some looting has happened of goods going in. Police protection is required. We thought of bringing in locals when the supplies are ready.
Communications. Only when reaching higher grounds there is some cellphone reception. This could improve over time.
Dependency. The help that is given should be supporting the priorities each village is taking in the relief and rebuilding process, and should not feed into the Dependency Syndrome that aid brings.","Building Collapsed, Road Damaged, Blocked Roads, Medical Assiatance, Food/Water/Shelter/Sanitation, Distribution Area, ","27.83739","85.8983","","Sindhupalchok","VDC","Raj","Gyawali","raj@socialtours.com",YES,NO,Urgent,NO,"",""

3.   Road Situation

Most major roads in the country are open. Road access to heavily affected VDCs is open via the following routes:

·         Gorkha: The road from Gorkha District Headquarters to Arughat (Arupokhari VDC) is operational, distance 43 km. The road from Arughat to Soti Khola (Lapu VDC) is also now open.

From Kimtang VDC, heavily affected VDCs of northern Dhading, Satyadevi and Darkha, are accessible on foot. The distance from Trisuli to Kimtang VDC is 35 km. (Kathmandu-Trisuli is 85 km by paved road in good condition.)

·         Dolakha: the main road via Khadichaur, Sindhupalchowk, Mude, Charikot and Mainapokhari to Jiri is open.

Bhaktapur

·         Scarcity of Drinking water is reported in the Taumadi Village and in main city areas due to damaged water supply system.

Dolakha

We were the first people there. All the people were traumatized, we witnessed multiple injuries, very poor hygiene conditions (lack of water, no spare cloting, barefoot), lack of food, water, electricity (-&amp;gt; no communication possible).

Immediate requirements:
- Recovery and sanitation of dead livestock &amp;amp; human corpses (dozens of bodies burried under debris in Asi Kilo)
- Landslides: villagers and rescue are at high risk: the ground is cracked and might just fall in at any time and/or cause landslides at the first (monsoon)rains.
- Water quality tests
- Sanitation and water
- Electricity
- Considering the water situation, a lot of people are prone to diarrea, cholera etc in the coming weeks.
- Volunteer labor and technology to rebuild the houses
- The aid we saw on the 29th was only on the main road (Turkish org distributing food + Medical assistance)
- Not much is going up, apart from some rice bags.
- Villagers told us the VDCs bought rice with the money normally allocated to build their road.

IMPORTANT: Volunteers going up there should be very fit.

Immediate needs:
- 500 tarps (one per family, and fitting 10 people)
- 5000 blankets (fleece)
- 2000 meters rope (cheap plastic thin rope + nepali jute dohai)
- 2500 slippers (adult and children)
- 1000-2000 clothes soap
- 1000-2000 dettol soap
- clean fabric for menstruation

MEDICAL DETAILS:
Most wounds were easily treatable with
- Betadine
- Gauze, cotton
- antibiotic ointment/tabs/caps
- bandages
- plaster casts
- pain medicine (tabs, syrup, topical gel)
- sterile water
- normal saline
- ORS
- sterile gloves
- tetanus toxoid
- injections
- water purification
- hand sanitizers/soap
- masks

MEDICAL REPORT:
over 100 people treated
major conditions:
- head trauma
- wound infections
- sore throats
- fever
- diarrhea
- blunt trauma with multiple small wounds
- new cuts from repairing houses
- referred emergency cases to the &quot;&quot;nearby&quot;&quot; free health care
ADVICE: follow up needed for the wound infections
Possibility of major epidemic due to lack of clean water and sanitation&quot;	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","VDC Trip Summaries, ","27.77","85.84","9803281686","Other","VDC","","","",YES,NO,Unactionable,NO,"",""

Luckily, my mother, brother, sister-in law and sister survived. 

We lost all properties of our birthplace .  I am keeping myself busy in counselling my family members……..as they cry at times…
 
The government has not been able to supply essential items to the earthquake victims to the Kavrepalanchowk district, only a few places are being covered. Dispute between the political parties have also affected to smooth supply of needy goods. 

There has been a lot of complaints from the public. I had also complained to the home ministry, district headquarters, prime Minister office…but administration is very slow...
 
As per my consultation with other village colleagues, 100 per cent houses are damaged/all are homeless. All rescue efforts are being done on the initiatives of individuals/institutions. An estimated of 311 have been declared dead in the district.
 
In my area, 5 people died due to earthquake. A total of estimated 1050 families got affected and 200 houses collapsed. Only a few number of people have been able to recover food-grains from their houses. 
 
If possible, we need to supply some very essential goods to the victims in that areas such as mattress (200), 200 sacks of rice, among others. Tents does not seem to be a problem now as these items are being supplied by individuals/institutions as well. We have to make a team in the areas with local participation and handover.

However, as these efforts have not been coordinated and as no supply chain has been established as of yet, our efforts have not been effective and aid has not been distributed in an equitable manner. Many villages, where there is no road access, for instance have not received any support and this is causing local anger, tension and is hampering the aid delivery and distribution process. 
In order to address this and to support the work undertaken by the many organisations and individuals, Clean up Nepal is undertaking a district-wide survey of the open shelters and number of people at each shelter in order to create a database that will assist organisations to contribute to needs more effectively.

We are seeking 200 proactive, independent and self-motivated individuals to collect this data at different VDCs of Sindhupalchowk tomorrow on the 3rd of May 2015. As many of these VDCs are not accessible by bus, we will require at least 100 individuals to have their own mode of transport, i.e. bikes. Data collection will take place in pairs and each pair will be required to collect data from one VDC. There are 79 VDCs in Sindhupalchowk. Most VDCs are accessible by bike.

An orientation will be held at the Clean up Nepal office in Minbhawan tomorrow on 03 May 2015 at 8am. The location map for the Clean up Nepal office can be found at: http://cleanupnepal.org.np/contact-us/. For more information, please contact Neelam Pradhananga on neelam_pradhananga@yahoo.com and Yam Karki on 9851 172 357. For URGENT inquiries only, please sms Neelam on 9808 211 827 with your inquiry and she will get back to you. 

If you are interested in volunteering, please fill out this form and come to the  Clean up Nepal office at 8am sharp tomorrow (03 May 2015).

This was one of the 4 hard hit areas as per the DHO. We took a bus to Simle village of Karthali VDC and then walked for 2 hours to reach Budepa Health Post. We also stopped at the Palate village of Barhabish VDC. We spoke to local people, community leaders and government health personnel regarding the situation of the VDC.

Physical impact
The area has been devastated.
-	Many houses (mostly non-concrete) have been razed to the ground. Even those that are standing have large cracks and are uninhabitable.
-	The road had many cracks but were motorable. A large landslide about 45 minutes’ walk from Simle VDC had cut off the road.
-	The new building of the Health post at Budepa was intact with minor cracks along the wall. The ground along the entrance of the health post had numerous large cracks, but was still walkable. The building of the Palate sub-health post is partially damaged.
-	Schools were badly damaged and can’t be used without complete reconstruction.

Human Impact

Medical:
During our one day health camp, we examined 121 patients of which less than 10 were directly affected by earthquake. Most were musculoskeletal pain and cut injury requiring dressing. One lady with both bone fracture of leg on her way to KTM, was splinted and given analgesics.

Housing:
Due to frequent aftershocks and damaged houses, all were sleeping outdoors under the tarpaulin or under lean-tos made of bamboo and corrugated tins. During the initial days of the earthquake, families shared shelters and ate in community mess. But now families are either living alone or a few related neighboring families were sharing the shelter and kitchen.
Groups of neighbors have started taking turns salvaging the remaining household appliances and housing materials from damaged homes.

Food:
The food stores have been buried under the rubble. As the intensity of aftershocks were decreasing, families have started removing the rubble for food. Also neighbors have been helping each other with food. 

Water/Sanitation:
The water sources were still intact and no pollution was reported. So, people are still drinking directly from the source. 
Toilets have been extensively damaged and due to ongoing aftershocks, people are defecating outdoors. 
Cattles and chicken crushed under the houses have started giving out foul smells.

Relief Response

Government:
-	No government relief response was noted.

Non-governmental:
-	We saw one group distributing sacks of rice to people of certain VDCs, which was, according to community leaders, the first relief program.
-	Ours was the only medical relief till then.
-	Delivery of relief material was made difficult by the inaccessibility of road, and difficulty in transporting the relief material. 
-	Pre-visit coordination with local community leaders and activists made the conduction of this visit smooth.

Summary and Recommendations
Sindhupalchowk has sustained massive destruction to its houses and infrastructure. The aftershocks are ongoing and transporting relief materials to remote places is very difficult. We recommend involvement of VDC secretary and All-party committee for any relief operation to ensure unbiased distribution.

The immediate needs are:
1.	Temporary housing that can last at least 6 months. It should be able to provide protection from upcoming monsoon. Also provision for temporary toilet should be made.
2.	At this phase, the local health facilities are able to provide the necessary medical relief. So, effort should be made to replenish their supplies. Also, the reporting of any outbreaks should be emphasized. Medical camps to provide primary care will produce too little output.
3.	Temporary housing for schools should be made a priority. The schools should be made the main focal point for hygiene, sanitation and epidemic prevention. This can be done by ensuring regular supply of soaps, ‘piyush’ and ORS to students to take to their families.

Long-term needs:
1.	Rebuilding the road.
2.	Long term permanent housing solutions.
3.	Rebuilding of schools.

Number of house destructed : Almost 100% household destructed
Number of Death : 8
Number of Causality : 15 to 20
Drinking Water : Spring Water (All water reserve destroyed, currently all villagers 
are relying on open source water without treatment or purification)
Sanitation : Entire toilet destroyed, currently all are using open toilet.
Type of House Make : Most of houses are made off of Mud and stone
Food Stock : Nil
Medication : 
• One health post exist but not operational since 14th of Baishak
• Currently villagers don’t have severe illness except minor fever and common cold.
• No diarrhea at present but due to carcass stuck on ravages of remains is expected to start contagious diseases. ( Degree: Critical)
• No access to even basic medicine facility.
As per our interview with local authority Mr Kamal Karki, there are 15 wards in Melamchi Muncipality. Approximately 15-20 thousand population with more than 6000 households. So far 812 people accounted dead and number of causalities are unaccounted. Major source of water is spring water, and no provision for water purification availed so far. At present sanitation is critical where open places are used for toilet. High possibility of risk of increase in contagious diseases.

This is from a FB post (sad sad one) of Sashank of a remote village in Sindhupalchowk district of Nepal.

My home is Sindhupalchowk, and I am from remote VDC Selang-9. My home and my village is completely destroyed. I have walked three hours this evening down to nearby Jalbire town. I had come to this nearby town hoping to meet some relief workers, but until now I am yet to meet anyone. I could access Facebook in Jalbire. I could not access the NTC and NCELL network. Sky (network) used to exist, but has ceased to work after earthquake.

Not a bit of chau-chau (ramen noodles) and biscuit has reached my village yet. I learned from Facebook that most think of Sankhu, Melamchi, Chautara and Barabise when they think of Sindhupalchowk. Sindhupalchowk is very remote, with 70-80 village development committees. This earthquake has destroyed the whole of Sindhupalchowk. 99% of it. Among my relatives in my village, 15 have died. This death may not even be counted or acted upon. If the rescue team goes to all villages and counts the death tool, there will most likely be 5-6 thousands in Sindhupalchowk alone. So many more are still unknown. Rescue teams have reached neither in our village, nor other 100-200 villages. We dug out many dead bodies through mutual help. Still many remain. Lots of animals have died, and it is beginning to stink. To reach my home, you have to walk further 25 kilometers from the Arniko highway. I know that there are many other villages that can be reached by over one day’s trek from my village. If nothing has reached my village, you can imagine if anything has reached in other villages.

I do not know why I am posting all this. There is a healthpost near my village. I know that people from villages located one days’ walk from my village come to this health post to get cetamol (popular painkiller in Nepal). I am not expecting that the villages that have not yet seen cetamol during all these years will see rescue teams.

Still I will be grateful if someone reads this post and tells the concerned agencies that Sindhupalchowk is big and remote. I will be truly grateful if someone takes initiative to ensure that supports are not limited to Sankhu and Melamchi, but all 70 VDCs including to our village.

Hello again Bijaya:

I am writing these notes you requested on behalf of Mr. Lotte Lama - a former resident of Upper Tsum Valley in the village of Chhokang Paro.  He asked me to send you his report.  These notes are in hopes of your facilitation of much needed food to the three areas of Tsum.  Nubri, Lower and Upper Tsum.  Lotte has heard from his sister who is a nun at Rachen Gompa near Burji.  The Gompa is easy to see from the air.  It has a red plaster and stone fence around the property.

1.  Barpak is approximately 30-40 miles from Chhokang Paro in Upper Tsum.  The trail to Tsum goes up the Budhi Gandaki and most likely completely unusable because of landslides. There are no roads into any part of Tsum. Helicopter is only way in now. 

2.  There are approximately 10-11,000 people in all of Tsum Valley.

3.  The people are in desperate need of food.  Rice, wheat, noodles, cooking oil and vegetables are important.

There were water taps in the villages and we don't know if they are still working.  There is a river through the main valley for Upper and Lower Tsum for water supplies.

4. They request warm clothes for babies, kids and adults.  The Upper Tsum sits at about 10,000 ft (over 3,000 meters).  It is very cold there right now.

5.  Chhokang Paro seems to be the hardest hit by the quake.  We know the village of Chhokang Paro is completely leveled. No structures exist now.  Unfortunately the grain and food for humans and livestock in mixed into the mess of rocks, timbers and water - and completely lost.  This is a huge humanitarian crisis as there is no way to resupply these residents by land. 
It is reported there is less structural damage as one goes up the valley toward Mu Gompa.

6.  In Lower Tsum - Ripchet had a substantial fire in the village.  There might be injuries there.  We don't know. We have not heard from Chumling. The trail is blocked. There is no electricity or communication in the valley.

7.  Nubri is to the west of these areas of Tsum and we don't know what has happened there.  Tsum residents have not been able to communicate with them. But it is similar to Lower and Upper Tsum - and very hard to travel there. There is a major monastery at Surang Gompa nearish to Nubri.  We don't know how they fared in the quake.

8.  In Upper Tsum there are plenty of open fields to land an helicopter...near Chhokang Paro.  There are fields to the immediate south of Ripchet in which to land.  There is a new trekkers' lodge at Burji and a field just to the immediate north for landing.  If the copter goes over a Mr. Dhawa Lama will probably come out to direct the copter to a landing spot.  There is a grassy field behind his lodge.  He is there now with some French trekkers.

9.  There is a nun at Domje in Lower Tsum who is trained as a dentist and doctor. She might be a big help if she can be contacted and given medical supplies.","Blocked Roads, Medical Assiatance, Food/Water/Shelter/Sanitation, ","28.505161","85.073058","+1-703-864-3622","","Region","Ron","Ranson","rranson@ucsd.edu",YES,NO,Urgent,NO,"","Northern Gorkha need/activity tracking document: http://goo.gl/WFp09O"

If you wish to talk to me, my number is 9818673545, 

In Bungamati there are 1200 families (4000-6000 people)displaced.

NEEDS: sufficient shelter for them to be comfortable whilst they rebuild their homes. At present there are some tents and plastic sheeting, but conditions are cramped. More shelter needed.

TOILETS: Displaced people do not have access to toilets and are defecating in the open, presenting serious health risks. LATRINES ARE A PRIORITY.

WATER: There is water in the communal tanks which is being refilled by tanker, however it is being used faster than it is being replenished.

RUBBLE CLEARING: There is significant damage to many buildings in Bungamati,and people lack tools and equipment to clear the rubble. 

They report they are ok for food and medicine at present, but could do with more clothes (especially children).

They also report that most of contributions have come from individual donations, rather than government or aid support. 

It is thought there is no one trapped in the rubble, but this is unconfirmed.

She is traumatised that the people are starving and have no place to sleep and no clothes to wear. They are sheltering in the ground of a local school without any support for their lives.
Almost 80-90% houses are wiped out according her,5 people were killed and around 70 are injured by the devastation. The focus has been on Kathmandu and city areas but we cannot forget our brothers and sisters from these remote places. I know our security personnel from Nepal are doing as much as they can but we need to hurry up. We need all the necessary items for the people who survived and rescue people who are still trapped. The roads are still inaccessible but it might get better by the time we mobilise resources for the people.  
The village is situated 50 KM far from the Capital city in the south and in geographically hilly region. The link here directs the place where we would like to support the people.

Although the main building of the clinic was destroyed, we believe that another section, containing medical supplies and some shelter is still intact. More importantly, the clinic is staffed by a physicians assistant and former army medic, who have escaped injury and are helping local residents. There is also an open level area (unusual for this area) that we believe is suitable as a helicopter landing zone.

Approximately 7,000 people, many elderly and children live in the Baseri region and it is the northern most settlement in that section of Nepal, approximately 25 miles from the epicenter. People seeking medical care will likely go to the clinic and we believe it could serve as a valuable staging area for medical assistance.

If you can direct me in any other way that would also be good. Good luck. I know you will need it.

"272","Carnage at Langtang","2015-04-29 10:53:00","Langtang, Rasuwa, Bagmati, Central Development Region, Nepal","Some information about the effects of the earthquake in the Langtang Valley, as well as the rest of Rasuwa:
 
 The village of Langtang was the site of the largest single catastrophe, as the entirety of village was completely buried by an avalanche that came from thousands of feet above on the southern slopes of Langtang Lirung and Langtang II. Smaller settlements on the outskirts of Langtang, such as Chyamki, Thangsyap, and Mundu were also buried. It is impossible to determine exactly how many people died there, but the estimate is perhaps over 300 people in total. The handful of survivors, roughly twelve locals and two foreigners, walked down to Ghodatabela below after spending the night of the 25th in a cave - thus there is no one at Langtang itself. This avalanche is perhaps 2-3 kilometers wide, and is obstructing movement within the upper valley corridor. Currently two large groups are stranded above and below (due to several intensive and recurring landslides in the steep sections between Ghodatabela and Lama Hotel).
 
 Above, at Kyangjin Gompa, there were reportedly fewer casualties (perhaps 5-10) yet many injured. Most of the injured have been evacuated via helicopter and there is an army medic team in place. Yet, currently, the problem is one of food shortage and illness. I have heard that the majority of the settlement, including the gompa, is remarkably intact. There is a smaller group of about 30-40 at the settlement of Sindum, about 4km below Kyangjin and closer to Langtang. This group has excavated several bodies from the major avalanche zone. They have also evacuated many of the injured, but are facing severe food shortages and illness (hopefully remedied by Nepal Army reinforcements and supplies on the evening of the 27th. Above Kyangjin Gompa, there were several smaller groups and climbing teams exploring the Upper Langtang valley, in a very high avalanche risk zone – I do not have good information on these groups, so please contact the respective embassies to determine who has been accounted for and evacuated via Kyangjim. As of the evening of April 27th, there was perhaps  120-140 people remaining above Langtang who need to be evacuated.
 
 Below, at Ghodatabela (where I was located during the earthquake for roughly 55 hours following the event) several large landslides were triggered from all directions, the largest from perhaps 1,500 meters above just below the settlement, completely obstructing passage. The two guesthouses there were partially destroyed by large boulders, and the army checkpoint barracks collapsed during the earthquake. The night after the quake, there were two groups sleeping in separate fields by the river, keeping distance from ongoing landslides and rockfall that continued throughout the night. The first Nepal Army helicopter arrived at about 8:30am, which dropped a “medic team” and took the injured from the upper camp; the second helicopter took more from the upper camp, a chaotic mix of Nepalis and foreigners. The group from below then moved up to the Army checkpost to evacuate their injured, however, the Army helicopter never came back (we were told due to fuel shortage and/or weather – however the Army did not have a radio or phone, or any means of communicating). After these helicopters came, Nepali survivors arrived from above and below, carrying several injured – this was the group closest to the avalanche – yet, unfortunately, the Army had no way of communicating this to the rescue teams. This added a high level of uncertainty to hours of extreme grief, as Nepalis arriving from above and below realized the scale of their loss.
 
 24 hours after the slide, the Army then moved the group to a single location across the river, which proved to be the safest location. In the evening, a private helicopter (with limited seats) arrived to evacuate a group of three Nepalis, yet they were replaced with the five most injured Nepali children (thankfully, yet forcefully). After this, a few of us worked with the Nepal Army to establish a formal triage list, which was 25 Nepalis and 2 foreigners (one Dutch and one Italian) for the next large Army helicopter, which arrived the next morning.  We successfully loaded the sick onto the helicopter, with a few other family members accompanying them at roughly 10am on April 27th. The army helicopter did not come back again until 645pm, and in between a private helicopter (a single pilot who did seven trips that day singlehandedly, pro bono) took two small groups of 6 people from Ghodatabela. The loading of all these helicopters was a highly chaotic experience, owing to both fear and ineffective/confused management on behalf of the Army. Communication improved throughout, but fell apart during the most emotional moments. At Ghodatabela, there was originally roughly 65 foreigners and perhaps 110 Nepalis - as of the night of April 27th there were still about 40 foreigners and 60 Nepalis stranded there. My hope is that another helicopter has been coordinated for this morning (I will refrain from the time being from being overly critical of the helicopter evacuation system, there are pros and cons), yet I fear that many evacuation attempts were limited by the storm system that came this afternoon.
 As of April 28th, as the aftershocks/tremors and rockfall have largely subsided, I was told that a few groups have successfully traveled from Ghodatabela through Sherpagaun via the high trail to Syaphru Besi. This is good news for the remaining, yet this is highly risky.
 
 Elsewhere in Rasuwa, around Briddim and Lingling and in several places along the road from Dhunche to Betrawati, in places such as Grang and Ramche, the majority of houses collapsed. I am not sure of the casualties caused by structural collapse. The Dhunche road itself seemed passable from the air, as there are no new large slides (other than the existing monsoonal ones), but I was told by someone walking from Syaphru Besi to Kalikasthan that a member of their group had fallen to their death while travelling. Along the Trishuli River valley itself, there are other smaller landslides and reports of significant collapse at Mailung, Simle, and Archale. In Betrawati, Gerkhu, and Mhanegaun in bordering Nuwakot district several houses also collapsed, and there were casualties in all of these places.
 
 The current data on total casualties following the earthquake here in Nepal is approaching 4,500. However, this is probably an underestimate considering that the estimate for the entire district of Rasuwa is 250, and there are at least 300 dead in the area around the village of Langtang alone. Across the board, it is still very difficult to determine exactly what has occurred in remote areas off the road system, as communication is down. Considered in terms of the percentage of total population, my sense is that Rasuwa has likely the third highest rate of fatality, behind Sindhupalchowk (at the epicenter of the major aftershock) and Dhading (closer to the center of the earthquake). Again, Langtang is probably one of the greatest single tragedies of this earthquake.

Bailey Meola and Sydney Schumacher, both 19, were trekking the Langtang Valley in Nepal when the earthquake hit, their families said Monday.
 
&quot;We thought about altitude sickness. We thought about malaria. We thought about falling on a rock. We never -- in a million years -- would've thought about this,&quot; said Diane Schumacher, Sydney's mother. &quot;It's been excruciating.&quot;
 
Both young women are described as experienced hikers, who began exploring the outdoors when they were toddlers. The teens are trained in first aid and CPR, their parents said.
 
&quot;The odds of them being injured are very high if they were in Langtang, but people have survived in that area. They've gotten out of the avalanche,&quot; said Rachelle Brown, Bailey's mother. &quot;We're just very optimistic. We think our girls have the resources. They have the skills. They have the experience.&quot;
 
Both girls are traveling around the world after graduating from Seattle's Garfield High School in 2014. Meola started her trip in Thailand earlier this year, also visiting Singapore, Cambodia, and Laos. She wanted to take a &quot;gap year&quot; and explore the world before heading to college, her parents said.
 
The families have turned to social media for help, hoping for word of the girls' safety through Twitter or other forums. They've been using a Facebook page for people missing in the Langtang Valley, along with a Google spreadsheet.
 
&quot;You just have to keep your phone charged all the time, checking updates, checking pages, checking news reports,&quot; Brown added. &quot;I've tried not to think too much about it in terms of wallowing in the worst-case scenario, but it's hard. We just want them to be safe.&quot;
 
Schumacher's older brother, Paul, did a similar trek through Nepal three years ago, which helped inspire his sister's trip.
 
&quot;Out of any young women her age, Sydney has the skills to survive up there,&quot; Paul said. &quot;She's been hiking around, trekking, since she was a tiny little kid. If anyone can do it, she can.&quot;
 
Both families have been in contact with the U.S. Department of State, along with other leaders, trying to get whatever help they can.
 
&quot;There are villagers who are injured. There are travelers who are injured, and they're waiting desperately with no food and no shelter in many cases,&quot; added Diane Schumacher. &quot;I've praying a lot. I'm not a religious person but I'm sending it out there all the time.&quot;
 
Schumacher last spoke with her daughter on a video chat from Kathmandu about a week before the quake hit.
 
&quot;The phone conversation we had was really fun and joyful and happy,&quot; she added. &quot;We reminded her to have fun and be safe.&quot;

"205","Langtang Valley - focsued on Ghodtabela","2015-04-28 23:25:00","Ghodatabela, Langtang","Some information about the effects of the earthquake in the Langtang Valley, as well as the rest of Rasuwa:

The village of Langtang was the site of the largest single catastrophe, as the entirety of village was completely buried by an avalanche that came from thousands of feet above on the southern slopes of Langtang Lirung and Langtang II. Smaller settlements on the outskirts of Langtang, such as Chyamki, Thangsyap, and Mundu were also buried. It is impossible to determine exactly how many people died there, but the estimate is perhaps over 300 people in total. The handful of survivors, roughly twelve locals and two foreigners, walked down to Ghodatabela below after spending the night of the 25th in a cave - thus there is no one at Langtang itself. This avalanche is perhaps 2-3 kilometers wide, and is obstructing movement within the upper valley corridor. Currently two large groups are stranded above and below (due to several intensive and recurring landslides in the steep sections between Ghodatabela and Lama Hotel).
Above, at Kyangjin Gompa, there were reportedly fewer casualties (perhaps 5-10) yet many injured. Most of the injured have been evacuated via helicopter and there is an army medic team in place. Yet, currently, the problem is one of food shortage and illness. I have heard that the majority of the settlement, including the gompa, is remarkably intact. There is a smaller group of about 30-40 at the settlement of Sindum, about 4km below Kyangjin and closer to Langtang. This group has excavated several bodies from the major avalanche zone. They have also evacuated many of the injured, but are facing severe food shortages and illness (hopefully remedied by Nepal Army reinforcements and supplies on the evening of the 27th. Above Kyangjin Gompa, there were several smaller groups and climbing teams exploring the Upper Langtang valley, in a very high avalanche risk zone – I do not have good information on these groups, so please contact the respective embassies to determine who has been accounted for and evacuated via Kyangjim. As of the evening of April 27th, there was perhaps  120-140 people remaining above Langtang who need to be evacuated.
Below, at Ghodatabela (where I was located during the earthquake for roughly 55 hours following the event) several large landslides were triggered from all directions, the largest from perhaps 1,500 meters above just below the settlement, completely obstructing passage. The two guesthouses there were partially destroyed by large boulders, and the army checkpoint barracks collapsed during the earthquake. The night after the quake, there were two groups sleeping in separate fields by the river, keeping distance from ongoing landslides and rockfall that continued throughout the night. The first Nepal Army helicopter arrived at about 8:30am, which dropped a “medic team” and took the injured from the upper camp; the second helicopter took more from the upper camp, a chaotic mix of Nepalis and foreigners. The group from below then moved up to the Army checkpost to evacuate their injured, however, the Army helicopter never came back (we were told due to fuel shortage and/or weather – however the Army did not have a radio or phone, or any means of communicating). After these helicopters came, Nepali survivors arrived from above and below, carrying several injured – this was the group closest to the avalanche – yet, unfortunately, the Army had no way of communicating this to the rescue teams. This added a high level of uncertainty to hours of extreme grief, as Nepalis arriving from above and below realized the scale of their loss.
24 hours after the slide, the Army then moved the group to a single location across the river, which proved to be the safest location. In the evening, a private helicopter (with limited seats) arrived to evacuate a group of three Nepalis, yet they were replaced with the five most injured Nepali children (thankfully, yet forcefully). After this, a few of us worked with the Nepal Army to establish a formal triage list, which was 25 Nepalis and 2 foreigners (one Dutch and one Italian) for the next large Army helicopter, which arrived the next morning.  We successfully loaded the sick onto the helicopter, with a few other family members accompanying them at roughly 10am on April 27th. The army helicopter did not come back again until 645pm, and in between a private helicopter (a single pilot who did seven trips that day singlehandedly, pro bono) took two small groups of 6 people from Ghodatabela. The loading of all these helicopters was a highly chaotic experience, owing to both fear and ineffective/confused management on behalf of the Army. Communication improved throughout, but fell apart during the most emotional moments. At Ghodatabela, there was originally roughly 65 foreigners and perhaps 110 Nepalis - as of the night of April 27th there were still about 40 foreigners and 60 Nepalis stranded there. My hope is that another helicopter has been coordinated for this morning (I will refrain from the time being from being overly critical of the helicopter evacuation system, there are pros and cons), yet I fear that many evacuation attempts were limited by the storm system that came this afternoon.
As of April 28th, as the aftershocks/tremors and rockfall have largely subsided, I was told that a few groups have successfully traveled from Ghodatabela through Sherpagaun via the high trail to Syaphru Besi. This is good news for the remaining, yet this is highly risky.
Elsewhere in Rasuwa, around Briddim and Lingling and in several places along the road from Dhunche to Betrawati, in places such as Grang and Ramche, the majority of houses collapsed. I am not sure of the casualties caused by structural collapse. The Dhunche road itself seemed passable from the air, as there are no new large slides (other than the existing monsoonal ones), but I was told by someone walking from Syaphru Besi to Kalikasthan that a member of their group had fallen to their death while travelling. Along the Trishuli River valley itself, there are other smaller landslides and reports of significant collapse at Mailung, Simle, and Archale. In Betrawati, Gerkhu, and Mhanegaun in bordering Nuwakot district several houses also collapsed, and there were casualties in all of these places.
The current data on total casualties following the earthquake here in Nepal is approaching 4,500. However, this is probably an underestimate considering that the estimate for the entire district of Rasuwa is 250, and there are at least 300 dead in the area around the village of Langtang alone. Across the board, it is still very difficult to determine exactly what has occurred in remote areas off the road system, as communication is down. Considered in terms of the percentage of total population, my sense is that Rasuwa has likely the third highest rate of fatality, behind Sindhupalchowk (at the epicenter of the major aftershock) and Dhading (closer to the center of the earthquake). Again, Langtang is probably one of the greatest single tragedies of this earthquake.

"941","Help Need in Nawalpur Sindhupalchowk","2015-04-28 14:45:00","Nawalpur, Bagmati, Central Region, Nepal","This is an urgent appeal. I just had a conversation with Babita Kushwaha working with Teach for Nepal. She came back yesterday from Sindhupalchowk, one of the worst affected districts but is neglected at the moment. Babita is traumatised that the kids she taught for one year are mostly dead now. She along with her colleagues even pulled out 40 bodies themselves including one of her own colleagues.
Does anyone know any organisations that can help in Sindhupalchowk’s Nawalpur village? The focus is on the main areas of Sindhupalchowk only. No organisations/relief is reaching Nawalpur as it is really a remote place. Urgent help is required.
Almost 80-90% houses are wiped out according to locals. The focus has been on Kathmandu and city areas but we cannot forget our brothers and sisters from these remote places. I know our security personnels from Nepal are doing as much as they can but we need to hurry up. Babita can be reached at 9841140634 and babita.k36@gmail.com.
We need all the necessary items for the people who survived and rescue people who are still trapped. The roads are still inaccessible but it might get better by the time we mobilise resources for the people. Please help me spread this message widely and be able to reach the right organisation and our government to send rescue team immediately.

Unfortunately the grain and food for humans and livestock in mixed into the mess of rocks, timbers and water - and completely lost.  This is a huge humanitarian crisis as there is no way to resupply these residents by land. In Upper Tsum there are plenty of open fields to land an helicopter...near Chhokang Paro.  There are fields to the immediate south of Ripchet in which to land.  Ripchet is one of the poorest places I have ever seen (Ron writing).   There is a new trekkers' lodge at Burji and a field just to the immediate north for landing.  If the copter goes over a Mr. Dhawa Lama will probably come out to direct the copter to a landing spot.  There is a grassy field behind his lodge.  He is there now with some French trekkers.
